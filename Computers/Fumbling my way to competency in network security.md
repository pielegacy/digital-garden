## Preface
I'm absolutely dog shit at networking, historically I've felt this is justified - there's only so much time to learn right?

I'm trying to turn a new leaf with this document though - at a minimum I want to understand how to correctly secure my web applications and setup a basic private cloud for accessing these services.
## Securing a server
This will be something I need to actually figure out - this will be step one in my journey to not being garbage with network security.
## Setting up a VPC
A quick search found this video from [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/g2JOHLHh4rI) that the comment section seems to really be getting around.
