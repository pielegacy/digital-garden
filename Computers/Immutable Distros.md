I recently purchased a ThinkPad X280 as I've missed having a laptop and would like to avoid spending most of my life strapped to a desk chair as I undertake some work on the side.

As an aside - I adore this laptop. The **sub**-1080p 12 inch display is very charming, the 16GB of RAM and i7 inside of it is doing the job and this is especially true as we get to talking about the software this device is running.

The goal was continue being insufferable and chuck Linux on this bad boy - I've landed on Fedora as my distro of choice however I was at a bit of a cross-roads with picking what flavour to use on this laptop. 
[Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) has treated me well on my desktop, but it felt unnecessary to install a primarily gaming focused distro on this laptop.
