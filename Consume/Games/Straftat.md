This game is insane. Where do I begin.
Is this what it feels like to have N64 nostalgia, it's so fucking fast paced and just genuinely so fun.

## What do I love?
* Genuinely reminds me of Xbox 360 era graphics
* Gunplay is janky but good janky, nothing is overly complicated but there's plenty of room for improvement performance wise
* Maps are inspired by Halo, Half Life, CoD etc...
