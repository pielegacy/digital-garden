## The Current List

## What Graphics Card?
I'm leaning towards just copping a 7800XT however getting the 9070XT would at least have me sorted for 5-10 years at a minimum
## What Case?
I hate the RGB look so much but also so many pre-builds have them and it's almost not worth going against the grain.
