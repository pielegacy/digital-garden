An FPS-RPG Hybrid, focusing heavily on stealth and rogue-lite mechanics. 

A reeled back First Person RPG is something that appealed to me and so far the game is _fine._

I don't really know the best way to describe how the game feels, I'm leaning towards *"heavy"*. 

Everything has weight; melee combat, gun combat, general movement. My pain points problem stem from a source of being shit at the game all things considered.
