This was an interesting play.

David Szymanski was a big part of me getting back into PC gaming last year. He's probably best known for his boomer shooter magnum opus [DUSK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/519860/DUSK/) but is someone who seems to pump out games at a breakneck pace. I find this admirable, I myself struggle to get a side project finished (story of every aspiring game developer I know) so seeing Dave's throughput is a personal inspiration and hope that one day I will find the momentum to get into a similar rhythm.

Butcher's Creek is his latest release. The game is a first person, melee combat oriented, horror game taking place in a town of the same name.

From what I can gather you play a [snuff film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_film) gooner who has arrived in the town looking for more material, instead realising that the creators of these films are cultists who produce them for their leader *"The Watcher"*.

It's a unique premise, as has become almost a trademark for the Developer - shockingly I'd say this game is much more grounded in the real-world than many of his other productions. 
I think the art style of the game compliments this - games like [Iron Lung](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846170/Iron_Lung/) make very little effort to provide a game world that feels relatable and even with DUSK whilst factory settings and lumberyards are not out of the ordinary but in the context of the game are eerie and fantastical. There's no mistaking on starting up Butcher's Creek that this is a town, combined with the early 2000's fidelity there is something almost nostalgic about the presentation. 

As an aside, it is incredibly cool to me that this era is becoming *"retro"*. I was born in 1997 with no older siblings nor parents who gamed. I never owned an N64 or PS1, whilst I adore the looks of games that match this era it is more because I love the gorgeous ugliness of the style rather than find it memorable.
The shittiness of Butcher's Creek's look however is comforting - I adore games such as [[Straftat]] for similar reasons. This attempted realism limited by what at the time was hardware restrictions has become a creative way for solo/indie developers to produce compelling 3D environments with less effort. The technical limitations even to this day apply, as someone with a Legion Go knowing I can get quality experiences without excessive graphical fidelity is exciting to me and as the handheld PC market grows this trade off for developers is sure to become a selling point. More of this please.

The opening level of Butcher's Creek gives you everything you need to know about the game, making it a quality candidate for its demo. First person, melee oriented combat - with a *decent* amount of jank. You'd assume it's intentional, the flat and weightless kick animation being used as a means of stunning enemies and sending cinder blocks flying at enemies at 50 km/h. Combine this with swing distances that always feel like they connect from an unreasonably long distance or never quite hit the mark (never on point), and a stamina system that is just *constantly* working against you - it's an interesting feeling game. I *think* I like it - not sure if I'm huffing the copeium but I'm happy to give the combat from the game the time of day as it is just so unique and almost fits the visual style in how off it can feel. 

I felt compelled to make this map of Melee combat feels and looks in FPS games to explain it as I think it summarises my feelings towards this game's combat (no reasoning for game choices was more just adding reference points):

It definitely feels better than a lot of other games but it's not crazy good and doesn't try to do anything too fluid with the looks. It's serviceable, something that really sums up how I feel about Butcher's Creek.

Enemy variety is *fine*, maybe if I was better at the combat I'd appreciate the different types but my strategy didn't change. Get them into a tight space, walk forward, swing, walk backwards, little bit of kicking, maybe a parry if you could time it. Some of the weaker thugs more acted as a really good way to remind you how nice the combat can feel when *everything* comes together as expected. Swings of the axe chopping a head off clean on first attack, staggering your enemies as you pummel them with a wrench, the odd throw of a knife hitting them exactly where you wanted - all really fun against the basic foes in the game. 

The story started off pretty strong but I felt as the game progressed it just became hard to parse. From some searching, this game is intertwined in the rest of Szymanski's projects but for the sake of avoiding spoilers and avoiding being wrong I won't go into that part. 
Are we still cool with note based story telling in place of actually understandable plots? I haven't got a hard-line stance on it as I just don't think I've played enough games recently to provide a well-rounded take but I got nothing out of pages scattered around the map. Aspects of it were way too meta for my own tastes and it does just feel this was meant to come together on a Steam forum post somewhere for people like myself to consume after the game to figure out WTF happened.

All this considered, what Butcher's Creek provides is a few solid hours of game with enough of an interesting premise to have kept me going. It goes off the rails a bit from both a story and gameplay perspective towards the end, neither sticks the landing to me but it wasn't enough for me to close the game and never touch it again. 

Personally the presentation and general "vibe" of the game were the highlights to me. Playing with headphones in I was consistently on edge and effective use of sound, lighting, and pacing result in a few well deserved jump scares. All negatives aside, I think it's worth the $15AUD I paid for it and definitely worth it on sale. Happy to see independent devs putting this kind of work out even if it is a little bit unpolished at points.
