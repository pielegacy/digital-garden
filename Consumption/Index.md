## What's consuming my time?
1. Working on that [[2025 Build ⁉️⁉️⁉️]] but making very little progress as the state of PC hardware is bleak
2. I'm attempting to enjoy [Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/) and honestly if I can't get into a rhythm with this game I need to accept I'm too smooth brain for text based RPGs
