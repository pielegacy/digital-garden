A negative stereotype of programmers is that we're typically very difficult people to work with.

It's never been easier to give a minimal amount of shits about your work but subsequently give off the facade of professionalism. You've probably seen the [Stanford "Workslop" study](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/26/ai_workslop_productivity/); take these studies with a grain of salt but the anthropological value of categorising these feelings and habits is comforting. We see a new findings about this every other week but the general narrative that is forming in my view is we've not necessarily become more productive thanks to AI but instead we've become so much better at describing what productive *could* look like.
